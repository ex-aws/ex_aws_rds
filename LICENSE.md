The copyright notice has not been updated, either with later years in which changes were made, or
with additional notices as to any copyrights held by contributors not employed by the original
(and only) copyright holder listed.
    
Given that non-compliance with the chosen license, I suspect [the Unlicense](https://unlicense.org/)
is more appropriate for this project and all changes made by me, Kenny Evitt, are released under
that license.

But the above quoted text was the license text as-of commit `783eb582` (presumably on 2019-1-7).
